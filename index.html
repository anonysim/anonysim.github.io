    <h1>My Web Design Journey</h1>
    <p>Through taking this web design class, I am hoping to learn the foundation of how to design a functional website. I do not currently have any intention of pursuing web design in a career setting, however that may change as I go. As of now, I am interested for <em>personal and creative reasons</em>.</p>
